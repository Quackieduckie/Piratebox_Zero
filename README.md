 Create a portable tiny local filesharing server that allows uploads and downloads from everyone that connects to it.

 Requires the following:

 1. Raspberry Pi 0 W
 2. UPS Lite V1.2 Power Board
 3. Micro SD Card
 4. Double Row Pins
 5. 4 M2.5 14-20mm screws

 Get the software from here:

 Assembly should be fairly straightforward, you may need to solder the pins at the bottom of the pi for better connectivity to the Power Board and cut the ones standing out at the top. Battery should last for around 4 hours or so, all configurations should be taken care of before you place the build into the case.

 There's some tolerance regarding the holes for the screws, you might have to adjust the horizontal hole expansion depending on temperature, material and layer height. It would be good to test print just the lid and see if the screws fit well enough. I use PETG for my build and had to add 0.1mm horizontal hole expansion in CURA.
